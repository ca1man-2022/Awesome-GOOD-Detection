This is a database for A survey of graph out-of-distribution detection and out-of-distribution generalization.

We collect and organize the approaches on the challenge of graph OOD, explain the difference between OOD detection and OOD generalization, and additionally present some insights that are intended to provide some key references for researchers in this emerging field.

1. We classify the existing methods for OOD detection into three categories: enhancement-based methods, propagation-based methods, and classification-based methods.
